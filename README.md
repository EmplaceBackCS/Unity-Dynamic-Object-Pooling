# Unity-Dynamic-Object-Pooling
This is a generic Object pooling script that will allow any number of any type of objects you want to add to a pool. It will then search and look for a name you give it to give you a pooled object. Even comes with an example of how to use for your game! 

The main script is ObjectPoolingManager.cs, the other two are just test and examples for you to see how to use it.

Please let me know if you used my code/it helped you, thanks!
